# RISC-V-single-cycle-processor-according-Hennessy-Patterson
The design implements a single-cycle RISC-V processor, according to the Hennessy-Patterson architecture. The design consists of an Instruction Memory, an Instruction Decoder, a Register File (32x64-bit wide) , a ALU (arithmetic logic unit) and a Data Memory. The Instruction an Data memory is separated from the processor itself.
